Question:- Find Unique-Occurences of elements  

Difficulty :- EASY  

Question's Link:- https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-number-of-occurrences/ 

Solution:- 

 PS:- I have used Brute Force and optimized it on the same with the help of discussion forums; 
 Also I have taken advantage of constraints and input. 
 Also I think if we have zero as a input in the array we may encounter some problems although 
 that may be tackled by initiazlizing all the members of freq[] array either below -1000 or above 1000.
                    
       
class Solution {
public:
    bool uniqueOccurrences(vector<int>& arr) {
        int countArray[2001] = {0};
        int n = arr.size();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            countArray[arr[i] + 1000]++ ;
        }
        int freq[1001] = {0};
        for(int i = 0; i < 2001; i++){
            if(countArray[i] != 0){
                freq[countArray[i]]++;
            }
        }
        for(int i = 1; i < 1001; i++){
            if(freq[i] > 1){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
